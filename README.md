This repo is built to store all the assignments I have completed for a database course taken in the CS department at the University of Toronto. The course code for this CS course is CSC343. This course provides me with a great exposure to a variety of topics, including SQL language (POSTgreSQL in particular), relational database and analysis on XML. Students who have completed this course will be able to quickly extract useful information from multiple tables using SQL language and perform data analysis with assistance of XML. The theoretical knowlegde gained from learning the relational database provides students with a solid foundation of understanding how SQL perform its data-searching job behind the scene. With the help of strong theoretical background, students will be able to check if the end result returned by SQL is correct. They can simply perform error-checking work and prove why the received data is incorrect if that is the case.
